# Filter the Codechef problem by tags and make your own tag using HTML | CSS | BOOTSTRAP | PHP | MYSQL | SLIM FRAMEWORK | CODECHEF API

I have created a web application for filtering the codechef problem. In this application when user is not login then we show him/her 
some filter for selecting the problem like on the basis of Difficulty , Tags and Author. If the user apply the filter then we show him/her
codechef problem according to there filters. And when user click on the problem then my application will redirect the user to the Problem statement 
area.
And when the user is login then one more fiture is added to our application. He can be create his/her own problem tags and add some problem in
those tags.This is privete for the user, any user can not see the tags of another users.
For the better understanding I am uploading some screenshot:-
